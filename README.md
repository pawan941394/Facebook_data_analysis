# Facebook Data Analysis

Welcome to the "Facebook Data Analysis" project, where we've embarked on an exciting journey into the world of data. With 98,000 records at our fingertips, we've harnessed the power of Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover valuable insights. Our adventure has led us through EDA, ETL, Data Modeling, Data Cleaning, and Data Analytics, all to tell a data-driven story.

    order by  count(userid)  desc

9. ***find the which age has highest user  in complete data base***
    ```sql
    select top 1 age , count(userid) from fb_data
    group by age
    order by  count(userid)  desc

10. ***gender which contains the higest number of friend_count***
    ```sql
    select gender ,sum(friend_count) as 'Total friend' from fb_data
    group by gender
    order by sum(friend_count) desc

11. ***age group having highest number of friend count***
    ```sql
    select sum(friend_count) , age_group from fb_data
    group by age_group
    order by sum(friend_count) desc

12. *** user which have the highest number of friend count ***
    ```sql
     select userid , age, friend_count from fb_data
     where friend_count =  (select max(friend_count) from fb_data )

13. ***highest number of like received***
    ```sql
    select top 1 sum(likes_received) , age_group from fb_data
